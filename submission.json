S. Houghton\n\nFrom: Ted Sanders\n\nSubject: Paper Technology Update for the Week of June 4\n\nReduced Sidesteam\n\nTrim\n\nShort-term plans have been formulated to address customer complaints regarding Virginia Slims Superslims. Models will be made which will evaluate lower tobacco density, use of outer wraps coated with potassium phosphate and/or short chain dicarboxylic acids (malonic and succinic), outer wraps containing mixed chalk (Albacar and Multicref), charcoal filters, increased chalk content in the inner wrap, increased basis weight for the inner wrap, and increased tar delivery (9 mg). A memo has been issued by Jeanette Hickle outlining the schedule for making these models. A longer term approach directed at improving subjectives is to design an outer wrap using mono potassium phosphate as the fluxing agent but at a porosity higher than has been investigated for full circumference cigarettes. Calculations have indicated that the greater effectiveness of the Multicref calcium carbonate/potassium phosphate system compared to the Multicref cosa potassium carbonate/sodium phosphate system can allow outer wraps to be designed with Corea porosity of up to 12 and still obtain greater than 70% sidesteam reduction for a 17 mg tar cigarette.\n\nA Superslims model with 50% of the Multiflex chalk replaced by Albacar chalk in the outer wrap was tested on the MC Panel versus a control Superslims. No significant differences were seen in any of the attributes. The only analytical difference was the slower burn rate of the 50-50 model. Although both of these models were essentially similar in every respect, they were both out of spec with regard to delivery (7 mg tar). Consequently, these models will be remade in Louisville to the correct tar delivery.\n\nLotus\n\nThe low sidesteam panel evaluated full circumference cigarettes with the Superslims double wrap system on Marlboro blend. One model used 100% Multicref chalk, while the other model had a 50-50 Multicref/Albacar mixture as the inorganics filler. Although neither model was judged to be subjectively acceptable, the panel could detect no differences between the models.", "answer_page": "nhxj0037_p0"}, {"questionId": 401, "answer": " The letter was sent by Ted Sanders.", "answer_page": "nhxj0037_p0"}, {"questionId": 402, "answer": " Richmond, Virginia", "answer_page": "nhxj0037_p0"}, {"questionId": 411, "answer": " This is a letter from H.

Unprompted comments were made about the circumference. These smokers said a low smoke product might result in less criticism of smoking\u2014if the nonsmoker was not a fanatic against smoking\u2014but probably would not result in compliments. Many of these smokers did not seem to be relating low smoke to VSSS but were thinking of a hypothetical full circumference cigarette\u2014a product of the future.\n\nWhen asked if VSSS lived up to the advertising claim that they give off 70% less smoke than a leading 100% cigarette, only approximately ten percent expressed disbelief. However, a percent reduction (e.g., 70%) really meant little (besides sounding impressive) because these smokers had not thought of visible smoke in terms of percents nor had they compared VSSS smoke to a regular circumference cigarette. They had no reason to doubt what the ad claimed.\n\nVSSS Circumference\n\nThese smokers said that a low smoke cigarette would be better if offered on a thicker cigarette (e.g., 25mm or 23mm). They said the thinness brought attention to their smoking\u2014something novel, very feminine but were not sure how long this uniqueness would be appealing. Some said the thinness brought attention to their smoking\u2014something they were not interested in doing. These smokers feared dropping or misplacing VSSS. They attributed the low smoke to the thinness of VSSS. When asked if they would be more interested in a reduction in smoke of 85% they said no because that would mean that the cigarette would be even thinner.\n\nSmoke Odor\n\nThe majority said that smoke odor\u2014specifically lingering\u2014was annoying to the smoker. They also agreed that nonsmokers were bothered by cigarette odors. The number one annoyance was lingering odors; however, many said all odors associate with cigarettes annoyed nonsmokers. Cigarette odors were viewed as more of an annoyance to nonsmokers than visible smoke. When asked about the odor of VSSS, forty percent said VSSS had a lighter, better odor (fresh and lingering) than a full circumference 100's. However, they said that this may have just been a perception because of the thinness and reduction in visible smoke.
